# nginx configuration role
# choose from:
#   - static: web server hosting static content
#     from /var/www/static/
#   - app: reverse proxy
#     (see also OCONF_NGINX_APP_PROXY_PASS)
#   - none (or empty string): no vhost configuration
#     This may or may not result in a crashing nginx
OCONF_NGINX_CONFIG_ROLE='app'

# additional configuration for "app" role:
#
# application proxy pass target
# This may either be a number or an arbitrary string.
# 
# If set to a number, the application is expected to
# listen on 127.0.0.1 under the given port number.
# Effectively, this results in the following nginx config snippet:
#   proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:<number>
#
# If set to any other string, that value is passed as-is
# to the "proxy_pass" nginx config variable.
# This may be used to specify a unix socket, for example.
# Do *not* include a equal sign character '=' in the value,
# as that is reserved for internal purposes (sed-edit).
OCONF_NGINX_APP_PROXY_PASS*='3000'
