# Whether to allow specific tcp/udp ports in the input/output chain
#
#   This is a value-merged variable,
#   (re)setting it will extend its original value.
#
#   Note that only port numbers are accepted,
#   network service names such as "http" are not supported, currently.
#   This helps to keep the deduplication logic simple,
#   but feel free to raise an issue if names are required.
